# Hello there! This is my first JavaScript project!
I made a JavaScript project in Scrimba's completely *free* JavaScript course! I did the first portion in one day (83 minutes), building a counting app. It ended up going really well and gave me **more knowledge and innovation about and for JavaScript**. :) You can find the app [here](anicount.netlify.app)
