# Simple JS Counter 
This is my very first JavaScript project (That was used for a website). Since I used a tutorial, feel free to do whatever with the code. You can find the app [here.](anicount.netlify.app)

If you want to test the source code using a server going live (with Python installed), do this:
Install Python 3, then type:
`cd (file path here for downloaded source code)`
then type:
`python -m http.server 8000`
You can choose a different port number if you like.
Then visit `localhost:[portnumber]` in your web browser.
(Node.js isn't as user-friendly)
